units: day, AU, Msun, rad
reference plane ecliptic
SSB = solar system barycenter
icrater from 1 to 60 (the name of the folder)

each ejecta/fragment has a unique ID given by (icrater-1)*78+ifragment

--- files capture_1000*.out --- the '*' is the zero padded ID 
 t (day from t0), Keplerian Energy wrt Earth, Keplerian Energy wrt Earth-Moon barycenter, SSB-centric particle state x,y,z,vx,vy,vz, SSB-centric Earth state xE,yE,zE,vxE,vyE,vzE, SSB-centric Moon state xM,yM, zM,vxM, vyM,vzM, heliocentric particle orbital elements a,e,inc,Omega,omega, geocentric particle orbital elements Ea, Ee, Einc, EOmega, Eomega
 
--- files capture_1.out capture_2.out capture_icrater.etc. ---
index of the fragment, initial time of capture, final time of capture (days from t0)
where index of the fragment goes from 1 to 78

--- file initialconditions_icrater.out ---
index of the fragment, crater longitude, latitude, initial ejecta speed from the Moon (km/s), azimuth, time (JD), SSB-centric particle state x,y,z,vx,vy,v,heliocentric particle orbital elements a,e,inc,Omega,omega, geocentric particle orbital elements Ea, Ee, Einc, EOmega, Eomega
where here ID of the fragment goes from (icrater-1)*78+1 to (icrater-1)*78+78

--- file escape_icrater.out ---
index of the fragment (as in capture_icrater.out), time of escape (days from t0)

--- file collision_icrater.out ---
time of collision (days from t0), index of the fragment (as in capture_icrater.out), index of the massive body following the JPL convention
#1-MERCURY,2-VENUS, 3-EARTH,
# 4-MARS, 5-JUPITER, 6-SATURN,
# 7-URANUS, 8-NEPTUNE,
# 10-MOON, 11-SUN
